Discussion
The new view object must be inserted into the view hierarchy of a window before it can be used. If you create a view object programmatically, this method is the

designated initializer for the UIView class. Subclasses can override this method to perform any custom initialization but must call super at the beginning of their

implementation.

If you use Interface Builder to design your interface, this method is not called when your view objects are subsequently loaded from the nib file. Objects in a nib
file are reconstituted and then initialized using their initWithCoder: method, which modifies the attributes of the view to match the attributes stored in the nib

file. For detailed information about how views are loaded from a nib file, see Resource Programming Guide.
